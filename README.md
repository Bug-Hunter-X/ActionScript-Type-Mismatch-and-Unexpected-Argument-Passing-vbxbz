# ActionScript Type Mismatch and Unexpected Argument Passing

This example demonstrates a common error in ActionScript related to type mismatches when passing arguments to functions.  ActionScript is a dynamically-typed language, but it performs type checking at runtime.  Passing arguments of the incorrect type can lead to unexpected errors or runtime exceptions.

**bug.as** showcases the problematic code where type mismatches cause the runtime exception.

**bugSolution.as** demonstrates the solution: using type checking or more robust error handling within the function.
